# Derby DUST Website Work

How I had development set up:

npx installed, I edited the files in the dev folder. I then used

'npx vite build'

which compiled the code for usage on an apache server in the directory above it.

This folder was hosted as a server using XAMPP and Apache, which I naviagted too using localhost/index.html


Current major bugs / incomplete features:

Going into first person goes black after clicking - this is related to the first person controls somehow, as going back to orbital resolves the issue

Theres no way to move between 360 degree images

Some boxes that shouldnt close after I press close on a different box also close
