# Derby DUST Website Work

How I had development set up:

npx installed, I edited the files in the dev folder. I then used

'npx vite build'

which compiled the code for usage on an apache server in the directory above it.

This folder was hosted as a server using XAMPP and Apache, which I naviagted too using localhost/index/html.
